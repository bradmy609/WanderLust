# WanderLust

#### Codeacademy Portfolio Project to gain experience using requests, APIs, DevTools, Jquery, AJAX, and HTML.

Open the project via the index.html file in the root folder. From there you will be directed to a webpage displaying the name of the webapp, "Wanderlust", as well as a search bar. Enter any city of your choosing into the search bar. When you click submit, code is run that will query the Foursquare API for the most popular locations within that city. Concurrently, the program will call the Openweather API to gather the current weather data for that city. 4 of the top 10 most popular Foursquare locations will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Above that, the weather and, city name will be displayed. Anytime you refresh the page, a random 4 of the top 10 popular locations for that city will be displayed.

# WanderLust

#### Codeacademy Portfolio Project to gain and demonstrate development experience using Javascript Requests, APIs, DevTools, Jquery, AJAX, and HTML.

Open the project via the index.html file in the root folder. From there you will be directed to a webpage displaying the name of the webapp, "Wanderlust", as well as a search bar. Enter any city of your choosing into the search bar. When you click submit, code is run that will query the Foursquare API for the most popular locations within that city. Concurrently, the program will call the Openweather API to gather the current weather data for that city. A random 4 of the top 10 most popular Foursquare locations within that city will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Above that the weather and city name will be displayed. Refresh the page to view another randomly chosen 4 of the top 10 most popular locations.
